## Course Description

Learn best practices in Python in six-session course. Topics include data analysis, looping, data types, flow control, and creating functions. The object of the course is not to a proficient python prgrammer but to introduce you to programming constructs that can be reapplied in other languages. 

It is best to use  your own laptop for this course, but if you don't have one please see your instructor.  

## Prerequisites

* No coding background is necessary.
* It would be helpful to have some familiarity with data analysis and working with data, but not necessary.


## Course Overview

We will dive into how to code in Python that will include an introduction to the language in the context of data analysis.  

Topics will include: 

* Working with data in Python
* Repeating actions with loops
* Python data structions (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
* Working with files and directories
* Writing conditional statements 
* Handling errors and exceptions
* Debugging your script
* Subset and perform analysis on data
* Parallel computing

Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides. Students are expected to follow allong. These materials are primarily adapted from the Sofware Carpentry lessons. If unchanged, I'll just link to their lessons below. 

## Quizzes and Tests

There will be in-class quizzes to reinforce the lessons.  We will also come up with a course assessment test.

    * Explain what an assertion is.
    * Add assertions that check the program’s state is correct.
    * Correctly add precondition and postcondition assertions to functions.
    * Explain what test-driven development is, and use it when creating new functions.
    * Explain why variables should be initialized using actual data values rather than arbitrary constants.
