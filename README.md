## Course Description

Learn best practices in Python in six-session course. Topics include data analysis, looping, data types, flow control, and creating functions. The object is not to a proficient python prgrammer but to introduce you to programming constructs that can be reapplied in other languages. 

It is best to use  your own laptop for this course, but if you don't have one please see your instructor.  

## Prerequisites

* No coding background is necessary.
* It would be helpful to have some familiarity with data analysis and working with data, but not necessary.


## Course Overview

We will dive into how to code in Python, . Pandas and BackboneJS will be discussed, but students will learn the building blocks of these frameworks and after this course be able to understand what is happening under the hood.    Topics covered include:

* Working with data in Python
* Repeating actions with loops
* Python data structions (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
* Working with files and directories
* Writing conditional statements 
* Handling errors and exceptions
* Debugging your script
* Subset and perform analysis on data
* Parallel computing

Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides. These materials are primarily adapted from the Sofware Carpentry lessons. If unchanged, I'll just link to their lessons below. 

## Quizzes and Tests

All assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

    * Explain what an assertion is.
    * Add assertions that check the program’s state is correct.
    * Correctly add precondition and postcondition assertions to functions.
    * Explain what test-driven development is, and use it when creating new functions.
