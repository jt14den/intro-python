## Course Description

Learn best practices in Python in six-session course. Topics include data analysis, looping, data types, flow control, creating functions and plotting. The object of the course is not to make you a proficient python prgrammer, but to introduce you to programming constructs that can be reapplied in other languages. 

It is best to use  your own laptop for this course, but if you don't have one please see your instructor.  

## Prerequisites

* No coding background is necessary.
* It would be helpful to have some familiarity with data analysis and working with data, but not necessary.

## Course Overview

We will dive into how to code in Python that will include an introduction to the language in the context of data analysis.  

Topics will include: 

* Working with data in Python
* Repeating actions with loops
* Python data structions (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
* Working with files and directories
* Writing conditional statements 
* Handling errors and exceptions
* Debugging your script
* Subset and perform analysis on data
* Parallel computing
* Working with Data on the Web

Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides. Students are expected to follow allong. These materials are primarily adapted from the Sofware Carpentry lessons. If unchanged, I'll just link to their lessons below. 

## Quizzes and Challenges

There will be in-class quizzes to reinforce the lessons. There will also be in-class coding challenges.
