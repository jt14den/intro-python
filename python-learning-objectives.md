# Programming with Python

## Analyzing Patient Data

* Explain what a library is, and what libraries are used for.
* Load a Python library and use the things it contains.
* Read tabular data from a file into a program.
* Assign values to variables.
* Select individual values and subsections from data.
* Perform operations on arrays of data.
* Display simple graphs.

## Repeating Actions with Loops
* Explain what a for loop does.
* Correctly write for loops to repeat simple calculations.
* Trace changes to a loop variable as the loop runs.
* Trace changes to other variables as they are updated by a for loop.

## Storing Multiple Values in Lists

* Explain what a list is.
* Create and index lists of simple values.

## Analyzing Data from Multiple Files

* Use a library function to get a list of filenames that match a simple wildcard pattern.
* Use a for loop to process multiple files.

## Making Choices

* Explain the similarities and differences between tuples and lists.
* Write conditional statements including if, elif, and else branches.
* Correctly evaluate expressions containing and and or.

## Creating Functions

* Define a function that takes parameters.
* Return a value from a function.
* Test and debug a function.
* Set default values for function parameters.
* Explain why we should divide programs into small, single-purpose functions

## Errors and Exceptions

* To be able to read a traceback.
* To be able to describe the types of situations in which typical errors occur.

## Defensive Programming

* Explain what an assertion is.
* Add assertions that check the programâ€™s state is correct.
* Correctly add precondition and postcondition assertions to functions.
* Explain what test-driven development is, and use it when creating new functions.
* Explain why variables should be initialized using actual data values rather than arbitrary constants.

## Debugging

* Debug code containing an error systematically.

## Command line programming

* Use the values of command-line arguments in a program.
* Handle flags and files separately in a command-line program.
* Read data from standard input in a program so that it can be used in a pipeline.

-----
## Intermediate Python

* Subset and perform analysis on data
* Display simple graphs

## Modularization and Documentation

* Write code for people, not computers
* Break a program into chunks
* Write and use functions in Python
* Write useful documentation

## Quality Assurance

## Parallel Programming
* Understand the major parallel programming models
* Learn how to implement simple multiprocessor parallelization
* Evaluate the performance speedup gained from parallelization

## Supplemental 

* Using python to interact with ArcGIS
